**Easy things to change for beginners:**

- Change the wording in the hero section of the work page.
- Change the colours in style.css using variables.

- Change the social media link addresses.
- Replace the demo words in the footer with your own bio.
- Replace the demo words on a project page with your own project title and project description.

**More advanced changes:**

- A solid working knowledge of HTML and CSS is required for more advanced changes. JavaScript knowledge is also helpful for custom effects. A great place to start is https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css.

**CSS Structure:**

- The main stylesheet is style.css. There are additional stylesheets for various features that you may want to use.
- The main stylesheet uses CSS variables for colours and fonts. This is a good place to start for beginners.
- The main stylesheet is mobile first. Minor adjustments for large devices can be made at the bottom of the stylesheet.

**Assets Structure and Image Optimization:**

A folder called assets contains demo images and graphics. Create additional folders for each project to keep things organized. Project images should be JPG format and ideally 1500 pixels wide for portrait, 1900 pixels wide for landscape, and under 750 KB. Optimizing images for quick downloading is very important. Do not add huge images or media files as this will slow your site down and could cause technical problems with GitHub. Videos should be uploaded to a third-party like Vimeo or YouTube and then embedded into the HTML code. Animated GIFs should be under 20 frames. Anymore more and it is basically a movie.
